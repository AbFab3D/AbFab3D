# ShapeJS Commandline Utilities

This application provides command line operations on ShapeJS files.  This includes tasks such as rendering an image and
generating triangle mesh.

## Building

From the apps/shapejs_cmd directory type:  ant build

## Running

### Ant
Ant does not support command line options very nicely.  These are provided mostly as examples of how to launch these

ant -Dcmd=renderTriangle -Dscript=test/scripts/gyrosphere.js -Doutput=out.stl run

Valid Commands and Parameters
* renderImage
  * variant - The variant to run
  * script - The script to run
  * width - Number of pixels in width, defaults to 512
  * height - Number of pixels in height, defaults to 512
* renderTriangle
  * variant - The variant to run
  * script - The script to run
  * meshErrorFactor - Maximal error allowed during mesh decimation (reducing mesh complexity). It is given relative to voxel size.  Defaults to 0.1

### Jar
java -Xmx12000M -jar <PathToAbFab3D>/apps/shapejs_cmd/jars/abfab3d_apps_shapejs_1.0.0.jar"

Syntax is:  command -option val
example:  java -jar renderImage -script test/scripts.gyrosphere.js -width 512 -height 512 -output foo.stl

## Testing
ant test
