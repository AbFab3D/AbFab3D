<h2>Recording Temporary Macros</h2>
<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">

<p>To record a temporary macro, do one of the following:</p>

<ol>
   <li><b>Go to the <a href="MacrosMenu.html">Macros menu</a>, then select 
         Recording Temporary Macro.</b></li>
</ol>

<p>The cursor will now have a little red "record" sign in it when it is hovering
   over a text document.  This means you are recording a macro:  all of your
   text editing actions, such as typing, cut, copy, paste, delete, join lines,
   undo and redo, etc. are being recorded!</p>

<p>When you are done, you should <a href="MacrosStopRecording.html">stop recording</a>
   your macro, or you will likely run out of memory.</p>
