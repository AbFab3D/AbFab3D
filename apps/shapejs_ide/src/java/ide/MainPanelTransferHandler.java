 * A transfer handler for RText's main view capable of receiving files

 * Note that this class is only used by the split pane view and MDI view, not
 * by the tabbed pane view.  This is because the tabbed pane view has its own
 * transfer handler subclassed from a different transfer handler allowing the
 * drag-and-drop of tabs from one location to another.  Methods such as
 * <code>canImport</code> and <code>importData</code> will return these
 * child components and not the main view, so we need to know what it is
 * ahead of time.
